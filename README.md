This project implements a Map Navigation System using graph data structures and algorithms in C. It features functionalities such as finding the shortest path between cities using Dijkstra's algorithm, simulating weather conditions and traffic patterns, estimating travel time for different transport modes (Car, Flight, Train), and dynamically removing roads. The system represents cities and roads with an adjacency matrix and offers an interactive menu for real-time updates and user navigation. This project showcases the practical application of data structures and algorithms in solving real-world problems.
